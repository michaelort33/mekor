# Visual Parity Assets

Tracked artifacts for native-route visual parity gating.

- `baseline/`: approved mirror screenshots used as CI baseline
- `approvals/`: immutable approval records for baseline refreshes

Baseline files are updated only via the approved baseline workflow (`.github/workflows/visual-parity-baseline.yml`) or equivalent local command flow with an explicit `VISUAL_PARITY_APPROVAL_NOTE`.
